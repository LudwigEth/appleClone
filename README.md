## Description

Replica of the current [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/) as of 19.01.2024. This project is a practice exercise to enhance basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. The goal is to recreate the Apple website visually without inspecting its source code, aside from retrieving the images used on the website or the colors used in fonts and elements, aswell as some svg's.

**Disclaimer**: This project is purely educational. I have no affiliation with Apple Inc., and this replica is created solely for private, non-commercial purposes.
